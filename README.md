# Project Estimator

![Demo of Project Estimator in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrjacobbloom/project-estimator/master/demo.gif)

This is just a little graphical tree editor that I use to estimate project
times for work. Those project times would probably be shorter if I wasn't
building this all day, but here we are. **[Try it!] (https://jacobbloom.dev/project-estimator/)**

This is also my first time playing with Redux!
